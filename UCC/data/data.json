      "description": "The statistical data generated through the administration of the Federal milk order program is recognized widely as one of the benefits of this program. These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\n\r\nAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\n\r\nThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report. New users are encouraged to use the \"User Guide\" to learn how to navigate the search screens.  If you are interested in a description of the Federal milk order statistics program, or want current data, in ready made table form, use the \"Current Information\" link.",

The PACA protects businesses dealing in fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables by establishing and enforcing a code of fair business practices and by helping companies resolve business disputes.\r\n \r\nThe PACA Branch is responsible for administering the PACA and offers many services to the industry. PACA Branch experts receive hundreds of telephone calls each week from companies requesting assistance on problems unique to the industry such as interpretation of inspection certificates, advice on contract disputes, and bankruptcy payments.\r\n\r\nThe PACA Search Engine is an online tool that allows the public to determine if a business is licensed under the PACA, users can also see companies trade name(s), branch location(s), principal(s), and other related license information.",

      "description": "The Dietary Supplement Ingredient Database (DSID) is a collaborative venture with the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements, the US Department of Agriculture and other federal agencies to provide analytically-derived estimates of ingredients in dietary supplements. Release 2 of the DSID reports national estimates for vitamins and minerals in adult and children's multivitamins (MVMs) ( http://dsid.usda.nih.gov).  For the DSID studies, representative supplement products are identified, sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results, a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study, with standard reference materials, in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information, if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2, data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.",

ERS has assembled more than 75 charts and maps covering key information about the farm and food sectors, including agricultural markets and trade, farm income, food prices and consumption, food security, rural economies, and the interaction of agriculture and natural resources.\r\n\r\nHow much, for example, do agriculture and related industries contribute to U.S. gross domestic product? Which commodities are the leading agricultural exports? How much of the food dollar goes to farmers? How do job earnings in rural areas compare with metro areas? How much of the Nation’s water is used by agriculture? These are among the statistics covered in this collection of charts and maps—with accompanying text—divided into the nine section titles.",

To provide policy-relevant information about diverse county conditions to policymakers, public officials, and researchers, ERS has developed a set of county-level typology codes that captures differences in economic and social characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe 2004 County Typology codes classify all U.S. counties according to six non-overlapping categories of economic dependence and seven overlapping categories of policy-relevant themes. The economic types include farming, mining, manufacturing, services, Federal/State government, and unspecialized counties. The policy types include housing stress, low education, low employment, persistent poverty, population loss, nonmetro recreation, and retirement destination. In addition, a code identifying counties with persistent child poverty is available.\r\n\r\nAn update of the County Typology codes is planned for 2014.",

Raw data for natural gas is for gross withdrawals, and oil data almost always include natural gas liquids. Note that State-provided natural gas withdrawals were not available for Illinois or Indiana; those estimates were produced using geocoded wells and State total production reported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency.\r\n \r\nIn the data file, counties with increases or decreases in excess of $20 million in oil and/or natural gas production during 2000-11 are also identified.

This series annually measures total U.S. food expenditures, including purchases by consumers, governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Because the term expenditure is often associated with household decisionmaking, it is important to recognize that ERS's series also includes nonhousehold purchases. For example, the series includes the dollar value of domestic food purchases by military personnel and their dependents at military commissary stores and exchanges, the value of commodities and food dollars donated by the Federal government to schools, and the value of food purchased by airlines for serving during flights.",

The aim is not to provide a single definition. Instead, it is to meet the demand for a delineation that is both geographically detailed and adjustable within reasonable ranges, in order to be usefully applied in diverse research and policy contexts. This initial set, based on urban-rural data from the 2000 decennial census, provides four separate FAR definition levels, ranging from one that is relatively inclusive (18 million FAR residents) to one that is more restrictive (4.8 million FAR residents).",

The series was started in 1945, and has since been published about every 5 years, coinciding with the Census of Agriculture. See the latest report in the series, Major Uses of Land in the United States, 2007.\r\n \r\nData from all 14 Major Land Uses reports have been combined into a set of files showing major land use estimates by region and State from 1945 to 2007. Alaska and Hawaii were added in 1959, when they achieved Statehood. Since Alaska contains such vast acreage, 50-State totals in all categories prior to 1959 may appear to change precipitously.",

To provide information useful for projections of future changes in land use, ERS has created a system to classify remaining farmland into \"population-interaction zones for agriculture\" (PIZA). These zones represent areas of agricultural land use in which urban-related activities (residential, commercial, and industrial) affect the economic and social environment of agriculture. In these zones, interactions between urban-related population and farm production activities tend to increase the value of farmland, change the production practices and enterprises of farm operators, and elevate the probability that farmland will be converted to urban-related uses.",

The ERS Rural Definitions data product allows users to make comparisons among nine representative rural definitions. \r\n\r\nMethods of designating the urban periphery range from the use of municipal boundaries to definitions based on counties. Definitions based on municipal boundaries may classify as rural much of what would typically be considered suburban. Definitions that delineate the urban periphery based on counties may include extensive segments of a county that many would consider rural.\r\n\r\nWe have selected a representative set of nine alternative rural definitions and compare social and economic indicators from the 2000 decennial census across the nine definitions. We chose socioeconomic indicators (population, education, poverty, etc.) that are commonly used to highlight differences between urban and rural areas.",

The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.\r\n \r\nThe 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.\r\n \r\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes is planned for late 2013.",

Each county in the U.S. is assigned one of the 9 codes. This scheme allows researchers to break county data into finer residential groups, beyond metro and nonmetro, particularly for the analysis of trends in nonmetro areas that are related to population density and metro influence. The Rural-Urban Continuum Codes were originally developed in 1974. They have been updated each decennial since (1983, 1993, 2003, 2013), and slightly revised in 1988. Note that the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes are not directly comparable with the codes prior to 2000 because of the new methodology used in developing the 2000 metropolitan areas. See the Documentation for details and a map of the codes.\r\n \r\nAn update of the Rural-Urban Continuum Codes is planned for mid-2023.",

Example computations and data are provided on the Documentation page.\r\n\r\n#### Spreadsheet Models\r\n \r\nFor each of the three major U.S. field crops, the Excel spreadsheet model computes a forecast for:\r\n\r\n1. the national-level season-average price received by farmers and\r\n2. the implied counter-cyclical payment rate.\r\n \r\nNote: the model forecasts are not official USDA forecasts.

As Americans have become wealthier and more ethnically diverse, the American food basket reflects a growing share of tropical products, spices, and imported gourmet products. Seasonal and climatic factors drive U.S. imports of popular types of fruits and vegetables and tropical products, such as cocoa and coffee. In addition, a growing share of U.S. imports can be attributed to intra-industry trade, whereby agricultural-processing industries based in the United States carry out certain processing steps offshore and import products at different levels of processing from their subsidiaries in foreign markets.\r\n \r\nThis data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering U.S. ports and their origin of shipment. Data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau.

LFP provides compensation to eligible livestock producers who have suffered grazing losses due to drought or fire. LFP payments for drought are equal to 60 percent of the monthly feed cost for up to five months. LFP payments for fire on federally managed rangeland are equal to 50 percent of the monthly feed cost for the number of days the producer is prohibited from grazing the managed rangeland, not to exceed 180 calendar days. The grazing losses must have occurred on or after Oct. 1, 2011. Sign-up will begin on or before April 15, 2014, at any local Farm Service Agency (FSA) service center. Additional details on the types of information required for an application will be provided as part of the sign-up announcement. Some eligibility restrictions may apply. Please consult your local FSA office for details.",

The objectives of this study were to: Assess how food security and food expenditures vary with SNAP participation. Examine how relationships between SNAP and food security and between SNAP and food expenditures vary by household characteristics and circumstances. Estimating the effect of SNAP on food insecurity using household survey data is challenging because households that choose to participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not participate, making it hard to distinguish the impact of SNAP from these other factors. This study sought to control for the SNAP participation “selection bias” by comparing information collected from households within days of entering the program (new entrants) to information obtained after about 6 months of participation.",

Direct certification is a process conducted by the States and by local educational agencies (LEAs) to certify eligible children for free meals without the need for household applications. States and LEAs directly certified 12.3 million children at the start of SY 2012-2013, an increase of 740,000, or 6 percent, from the previous school year. Over the same period, the population of school-age SNAP participant children increased by just 1.5 percent. As a result, the share of SNAP participant children certified for free school meals without application increased to 89 percent in SY 2012-2013, up from 86 percent in SY 2011-2012.",

The adjusted income eligibility guidelines are used by State agencies in determining the income eligibility of persons applying to participate in the WIC Program. WIC State agencies must implement the new guidelines not later than July 1, 2014. WIC State agencies may implement the revised income guidelines at the same time States implement revised income eligibility guidelines for the Medicaid Program. On January 22, 2014, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published its annual update of the poverty guidelines (79 FR 3593). The HHS guidelines are used by a number of Federal programs, including WIC and the Medicaid Program, as the basis for determining and updating program income eligibility limits.",

      "description": "The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency among FIA work units than earlier inventories. Links to field collection manuals and the FIADB user’s manual are  provided in the FIA DataMart.",

Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS Enterprise Data Warehouse. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features.The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Linear features (streams & rivers) FCODES 46003 and 46006 and polygonal features (lakes and other waterbody) FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43612, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittentt/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. Underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. The resulting avoidance areas may have overlapping features due to the buffering processes.The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.",

Since it is vertically integrated when coincident with Forest Service lands, this dataset allows for better multi-layer analysis with other Forest Service lands data, and improved cartographic applications where Census data and Forest Service data need to be depicted in the same map.

The NatureServe Explorer provides descriptions for each ecological system including species, distribution and classification information. Three main elements comprise LANDFIRE Existing Vegetation. Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) characterizes the types and complexes of plant communities on the landscape, Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) is the vertically projected percent cover of the live canopy layer for a specific area for a specific life-form, and Existing Vegetation Height (EVH) is the average height of the dominant vegetation. \r\nExisting Vegetation Type, Cover, and Height agree by life-form for every pixel.

MFRI is intended to describe one component of historical fire regime characteristics in the context of the broader historical time period represented by the LANDFIRE Biophysical Settings (BPS) layer and BPS Model documentation. MFRI is derived from the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model VDDT (Vegetation Dynamics Development Tool) (LF_1.0.0 CONUS only used the vegetation and disturbance dynamics model LANDSUM). This layer is created by linking the BpS Group attribute in the BpS layer with the Refresh Model Tracker (RMT) data and assigning the MFRI attribute. This geospatial product should display a reasonable approximation of MFRI, as documented in the RMT. MFRI is used in landscape assessments.",

Each BpS map unit is matched with a model of vegetation succession, and both serve as key inputs to the LANDSUM landscape succession model. As used in LANDFIRE, map unit names represent the natural plant communities that may have been present during the reference period.

It contains the Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRA) that were used in the Final Environmental Impact Statement for the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule. The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service’s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information.",

The EIS analysis team used this spatial data to assess the impacts of roadless area alternatives on Forest Service policies, use of the National Forests, and the surrounding environment. It was used for analysis in combination with national characterization layers, such as ambient human population, forest mortality risk to insects and diseases, current land cover types, and others. The data includes the entire lower 48 states and Alaska at a coarse resolution. The public also had a need to know where IRAs were located in their area and across the nation.

The dataset depicted in this map service provides a watershed index of surface drinking water importance, a watershed index of forest importance to surface drinking water, and a watershed index to highlight the extent to which development, fire, and insects and disease threaten forests important for surface drinking water. This tabular dataset is meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. The results of this assessment provides information that can identify areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality. The spatial dataset can be incorporated into broad-scale planning, such as the State Forest Action Plans, and can be incorporated into existing decision support tools that currently lack spatial data on important areas for surface drinking water. This project also sets the groundwork for identifying watersheds where a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme may be an option for financing forest conservation and management on private unprotected forest lands. In perhaps its most important but most basic role, this work can serve as an education tool helping to illustrate the link between forests and provision of key watershed-based ecosystem services.",

The feature class was later reprojected to WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxillary sphere) to optimize it for the Tribal Connections Map Viewer. Polygon boundaries were digitized as to not deviate from the drawn polygon edge to the extent that space could be seen between the digitized polygon and the mapped polygon at a viewable scale. Topology was maintained between coicident edges of adjacent polygons. Each cession was labeled with a unique cession number, which was entered into the feature class as a field attribute. The cession number serves as the link referencing relationship classes, joining additional attribute information from statewide NAGRPA tables, and Cession Dates, (as transcribed from Royce's Schedule of Land Cessions.)",

The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into a Conterminous US-wide extent, and adding a Conterminous US-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing \"ready to map\" attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. \r\n\r\nThe raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.\r\n\r\nThe value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.\r\n\r\nThe Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national, regional, and state-wide resource planning and analysis of soils data.

      "description": "The United States, Caribbean and Pacific Basin Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) Geographic Database serves as the geospatial expression of the map products presented and described in Agricultural Handbook 296 (2006).  Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined.  They are also the basic units for State land resource maps.  LRUs are typically coextensive with State general soil map units, but some general soil map units are subdivided into LRUs because of significant geographic differences in soils, climate, water resources, or land use.  LRUs generally are several thousand acres in size.  A unit can be one continuous area or several separate areas that are near each other.  In 2005, these areas were designated as common resource areas (CRAs) within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  CRAs are created by subdividing MLRAs by topography, other landscape features, hydrologic units, resource concerns, resource uses, and human considerations affecting use and soil and water conservation treatment needs.  Common resource areas, or land resource units, are not described in this handbook and are not shown on the national map.  Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units.  Land resource regions are a group of geographically associated major land resource areas. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.  In order to make this handbook more useful to other Federal agencies and private parties using ecological regions for planning or evaluation of natural resources programs and policies, Appendix I (Agriculture Handbook 296, 2006) cross-references MLRAs with Environmental Protection Agency Level III Ecoregions (USEPA, 2003; Omernik, 1987) and U.S. Forest Service ecological sections (Cleland and others, 2005; McNab and others, 2005).  In this handbook, major land resource areas are generally designated by Arabic numbers and identified by a descriptive geographic name.  Examples are MLRA 1 (Northern Pacific Coast Range, Foothills, and Valleys); MLRA 154 (South-Central Florida Ridge); and MLRA 230 (Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands).  Some MLRAs are designated by an Arabic number and a letter because previously established MLRAs have been divided into smaller, more homogeneous areas, for example, MLRAs 102A, 102B, and 102C.  The use of numbers and letters to identify the newly created MLRAs requires fewer changes in existing information in records and in databases.  A few MLRAs consist of two or more parts separated for short distances by other land resource areas.  In places one of these parts is widely separated from the main body of the MLRA and is in an adjoining LRR.  The description of the respective MLRA also applies to these outlying parts.",

The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.\r\n\r\nThis dataset consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.\r\n\r\nSSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.",
